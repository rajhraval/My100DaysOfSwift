## Project 30 - HackingWithSwift - 100DaysOfSwift Challenge

**Project 30 - Day One - Day 97 of 100DaysOfSwift**

> If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. - Edsger Dijkstra 

Today I did (Time Profilers, Allocations Instruments, Advance CoreGraphics and CALayer):

- Setting up the downloaded project in Xcode 
- Understanding what the broken app does and what are the flaws
- Understanding how Instruments work and help
- Fixing the show shadows for better time profiling
- Fixing table view cells for better memory allocations
